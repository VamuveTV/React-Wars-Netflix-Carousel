# React-Wars-Carousel
This is a refactored version of a React Sprint with a Netflix-esque carousel in React hooks. React Star Wars Carousel is currently two separately deployed apps using create-react-app which will be merged in to one final application. The other calls data from the star wars API and maps character qualities.
